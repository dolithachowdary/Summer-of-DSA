# Day 12: Optimized Problems with Explanations and Inline Comments

# Problem 1: Optimised Aggressive Cows
# Goal: Place 'k' cows in 'n' stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.
# Approach:
# 1. Sort the positions of the cows.
# 2. Use binary search to find the maximum minimum distance.
# 3. Check if it is possible to place cows with the given minimum distance.
# 4. If it is possible, try for a larger distance, otherwise try a smaller distance.    
# 5. Return the maximum minimum distance found.
# 6. The time complexity is O(n log m), where n is the number of cows and m is the maximum distance.
# 7. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using only a few variables to store the positions and distances.

# Problem 2: Allocate Minimum Number of Pages
# Goal: Allocate books to students such that the maximum number of pages assigned is minimized.
# Approach:
# 1. Use binary search over the range [max(book), sum(books)].
# 2. Check if itâ€™s possible to allocate pages within mid as max to all students.
# 3. If possible, try for smaller max. Else increase.
