# 📘 Project Description: Summer of DSA (Python)

Welcome to my **Summer of DSA** journey — a collection of Python programs solving essential Data Structures and Algorithm problems, organized day by day. This is a self-paced learning initiative to practice, revise, and strengthen core problem-solving skills using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to:

- Practice a wide range of DSA problems regularly.
- Improve Python problem-solving and logic-building skills.
- Create a consistent coding habit.
- Build a portfolio of well-commented Python solutions.

---

## 🗂️ Current Structure

Each day’s problems are written in separate Python files (e.g., `day1.py`, `day2.py`) or placed inside folders (`Day1/`, `Day2/`), depending on complexity.

## 📅 Day-Wise Highlights

### ✅ Day 6:  
**Recursion - Part 3 + Backtracking**

🔁 Recursive Problems:
- Product of digits in an integer
- Reverse a string recursively
- Check if a string is palindrome
- Power of a number (x^n)
- Check if an array is strictly increasing
- Binary search recursively
- First and last index of element in a list
- Print all subsets of a string
- GCD using recursion

🔍 Backtracking Problems:
- Generate all subsets (Power set) of a list
- Generate all combinations of `n choose k`
- Letter case permutation for a string
- Generate well-formed parentheses (balanced)
- Word break using dictionary

---

## 🛠 Tech Used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Tools:** Any editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter)

---

## 🔄 Upcoming Additions

- Daily problems from advanced topics (e.g., recursion, sorting, linked lists, trees)
- Unit testing and time-space complexity notes

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

By the end of this project, I aim to:

- Gain fluency in solving DSA problems using Python
- Improve coding speed and algorithmic thinking
- Maintain clean, modular code with practice
- Build a public portfolio of structured learning
