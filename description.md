# 📘 Project Description: Summer of DSA (Python)

Welcome to my **Summer of DSA** journey — a collection of Python programs solving essential Data Structures and Algorithm problems, organized day by day. This is a self-paced learning initiative to practice, revise, and strengthen core problem-solving skills using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to:
- Practice a wide range of DSA problems regularly.
- Improve Python problem-solving and logic-building skills.
- Create a consistent coding habit.
- Build a portfolio of well-commented Python solutions.

---

## 🗂️ Current Structure

Each day’s problems are written in separate Python files (e.g., `day1.py`, `day2.py`) or placed inside folders (`Day1/`, `Day2/`), depending on complexity.

## 📅 Day-Wise Highlights

### ✅ Day 1:
- Unique elements in a list
- Prime number checker
- Vowel counting in a string
- ASCII-based value summing
- Custom case switching
- Interleaving strings with uppercase remaining
- Substring and circular match check
- Run-length decoding patterns (e.g., `3a4b5c` → `aaabbbbccccc`)

---

### ✅ Day 2:
- First missing positive integer
- Move zeros to end
- Move even numbers to end
- Swap numbers with zeros
- Count set bits in binary
- Reordering odd and even elements

---

### ✅ Day 3:
**Bit Manipulation:**
- Decimal to binary (manual and bitwise)
- Binary to decimal
- Count number of 1’s and 0’s in binary
- First set bit from right and left
- Set or unset i-th bit
- Check if number is a power of 2
- XOR to find duplicate in array

**Recursion:**
- Count digits in a number using recursion

---

## 🛠 Tech Used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Tools:** Any editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter)

---

## 🔄 Upcoming Additions

- Daily problems from advanced topics (e.g., recursion, sorting, linked lists, trees)
- More structured folders with README inside each day
- Unit testing and time-space complexity notes

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

By the end of this project, I aim to:
- Gain fluency in solving DSA problems using Python
- Improve coding speed and algorithmic thinking
- Maintain clean, modular code with practice

---

Let’s keep learning and coding! 🌱✨
