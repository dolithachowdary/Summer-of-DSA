# 📘 Project Description: Summer of DSA (Python)

Welcome to my **Summer of DSA** journey — a collection of Python programs solving essential Data Structures and Algorithm problems, organized day by day. This is a self-paced learning initiative to practice, revise, and strengthen core problem-solving skills using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to:

- Practice a wide range of DSA problems regularly.
- Improve Python problem-solving and logic-building skills.
- Create a consistent coding habit.
- Build a portfolio of well-commented Python solutions.

---

## 🗂️ Current Structure

Each day’s problems are written in separate Python files (e.g., `day1.py`, `day2.py`) or placed inside folders (`Day1/`, `Day2/`), depending on complexity.

- Binary to decimal
- Count number of 1’s and 0’s in binary
- First set bit from right and left
- Set or unset i-th bit
- Check if number is a power of 2
- XOR to find duplicate in array

**Recursion:**
