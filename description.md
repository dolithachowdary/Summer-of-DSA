# 📘 Project Description: Summer of DSA (Python)

Welcome to my **Summer of DSA** journey — a collection of Python programs solving essential Data Structures and Algorithm problems, organized day by day. This is a self-paced learning initiative to practice, revise, and strengthen core problem-solving skills using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to:

* Practice a wide range of DSA problems regularly.
* Improve Python problem-solving and logic-building skills.
* Create a consistent coding habit.
* Build a portfolio of well-commented Python solutions.

---

## 🗂️ Current Structure

Each day’s problems are written in separate Python files (e.g., `day1.py`, `day2.py`) or placed inside folders (`Day1/`, `Day2/`), depending on complexity.
