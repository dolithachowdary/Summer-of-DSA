# Summer-of-DSA
# 🌞 Summer of DSA

Welcome to my **Summer of DSA** repository!  
This repo contains all the advanced Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions I practiced during my summer training/classes — organized **day-wise** and written in **Python 🐍**.

---

## 📌 About the Repository

This repository is a collection of my daily DSA practice during the summer break. The problems include a wide range of advanced topics including but not limited to:

- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees & Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers
- Segment Trees & Binary Indexed Trees
- Advanced Sorting and Searching
- Trie, Heap, Union-Find and more!

Each folder corresponds to one day of learning and contains Python scripts for the problems solved on that day.
